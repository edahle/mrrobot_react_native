Now it’s up to a nervous Elliot to pose as a tech billionaire touring the facility so he can plant the device on a thermostat. When Elliot finally manages to shrug off his tour guide, he runs right into Tyrell Wellick. Elliot bluffs about why he’s there and then quickly figures out how to use having lunch with Tyrell as a way of gaining access to the restricted floor. Then Elliot excuses himself to go to the bathroom, where he starts installing the device in the adjacent janitor closet, but Tyrell’s entrance halts his progress. Tyrell says he knows that Elliot framed Terry Colby for the Evil Corp hack, but he believes Elliot did so as revenge for his father’s death, which lessens Tyrell’s opinion of him. After saying that he isn’t going to bother to turn him in, Tyrell leaves, giving Elliot the precious chance he needs to finish the job.",

Krista signs his papers while urging him to continue their work. His response is to take his completed form and leave. After a few days, however, Elliot returns to her office.
